## Intro

This project is an example implementation addressing some of principles behind the SCS architecture and front-end integration. This project provides different service implementations (merely stubs without actual persistence implementation) that integrate in different scenarios appropriate for each specific problem domain.

The service landscapes which aims to build an easy and simple to use ecommerce system involves a couple of systems like [ordering](https://github.com/scs-commerce/order), [product listing](https://github.com/scs-commerce/product-list)  and a [landing page](https://github.com/scs-commerce/landing-page) which reintegrates the different domains.
